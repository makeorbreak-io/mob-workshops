## CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

We're looking for talented people to improve the quality and broaden the spectrum of our workshops at this year's Make or Break. If you have a workshop you'd like to present, send us an email to info@makeorbreak.io with the title "Workshop Proposal". Your proposal should contain your short bio and an outline of your workshop.

### What type of workshop are we looking for?
Being mainly a technological event, must of our workshops are technical in nature. Despite that, we always like to learn new and cool stuff, so if you have a really interesting hobby, like juggling, cooking or knife sharpening, and you'd like to share with the community, send us your proposal.

### Valid workshop formats
The workshop must be comprised of a single session of up to 3 hours. Workshops that are more hands-on and promote attendee participation are preferred. Thereâ€™s a limited budget for material so if you have any special requirements, make sure to include those in your proposal.
