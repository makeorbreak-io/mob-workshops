## CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

We're looking for talented people to improve the quality and broaden the spectrum of our workshops at this year's Make or Break. If you have a workshop you'd like to present, send us an email to info@makeorbreak.io with the title "Workshop Proposal".  
Your proposal should contain your short bio and an outline of your workshop.

### What type of workshop are we looking for?
Being mainly a technological event, most of our workshops are technical in nature. Despite that, we always like to learn new and cool stuff, so if you have a really interesting hobby, like juggling, cooking or knife sharpening, and you'd like to share it with the community, send us your proposal.

### Valid workshop formats
The workshop must be comprised of a single session of up to 3 hours.  
Workshops are inherently different from talks, so make sure your approach is more hands-on and promotes attendee participation.  
Thereâ€™s a limited budget for material so if you have any special requirements, make sure to include those in your proposal.

## About Make or Break
Make or Break is a 3-day tech event in the city of Porto, Portugal.  
You can join us on April 13, 14, and 15, to participate on our hackathon or workshops. The participation is free and there are prizes for the winners!
